=========
Icon Role
=========

The ``icon`` role allows you to render icons from the
`FontAwesome <https://fontawesome.com/>`__ icon font. This role also
generates a caption for screen readers, no-CSS browsers, and non-HTML
Sphinx builders.

This caption is automatically derived from the FontAwesome class name
if not explicitly provided.

In your ``conf.py``, add ``'icon'`` to the ``extensions``
list.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: rst

      Press the :icon:`windows` key. This has the caption ``windows icon``.

      Press the :icon:`Windows logo <windows>` key. This has the caption
      ``Windows logo``.

   Press the :icon:`windows` key. This has the caption ``windows icon``.

   Press the :icon:`Windows logo <windows>` key. This has the caption
   ``Windows logo``.

See the `Font Awesome icon gallery <https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery>`__
for a list of available icons.
